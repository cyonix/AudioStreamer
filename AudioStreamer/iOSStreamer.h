 * The iOSStreamer subclass is for those using <AudioStreamer> on iOS.

 *
 * This class adds:
 *
 * - Ability to play audio while your app is in the background
 * - Interruption handling (eg. phone calls)
 * - Ability to play concurrent streams
 *
 * You only need to replace "AudioStreamer" with "iOSStreamer" in your
 * code. Everything else is handled for you which is why there is little
 * additional properties and methods.
